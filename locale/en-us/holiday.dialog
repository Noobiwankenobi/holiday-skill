First i am going to forlandia in brazil. i am interested in the history of punch card time clocks for obvious reasons. i don't know if you have heard of fordlandia? henry ford tried to build his own rubber plantation there. it was a complete failure. the brazilian work force did not appreciate ford controlling what they ate and when they worked. there were frequent strikes and the punch-card time clocks often felt the ire of the workforce. i want to hear the stories of those old clocks. then i am spending a few days in nottingham. i plan to visit some sites associated the the luddites.
